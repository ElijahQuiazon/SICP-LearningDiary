# Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs (SICP)
This repository documents my learning journey as I go through the SICP.

## Overview

This repository documents my key learning takeaways from the SICP.

This is a book that was the recommended resource by [teachyourselfcs](https://teachyourselfcs.com/). 

I picked up this book to establish a strong foundation in programming. As a self-taught individual, I noticed that I was hammering out code without truly understanding key concepts of the craft. Hence, I decided it would be crucial to start from the ground-up to flourish in the long run. 

## Contents

At the moment, this repository will contain my documentations on two areas: key concepts learnt and answers to practice questions.
